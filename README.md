# Fractured Media Flow – XFEM/EDFM/DG Models

This repository contains implementations of:
- Unfitted Poisson solvers (XFEM)
- Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Poisson / Stokes / Biot / Brinkman models
- Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM)
- Discrete Fracture Model (DFM)
- Interface problems based on level sets

## Structure
- notebooks/: Demonstration notebooks
- src/: Reusable Python modules (XFEM, DG, Brinkman, DFM, EDFM)
- examples/: Minimal runnable examples

## notes/
This folder contains reading notes, derivations, and research logs.
These documents help track the development of the project and summarize key
ideas from the literature on XFEM, EDFM, DG methods, and flow in fractured media.
