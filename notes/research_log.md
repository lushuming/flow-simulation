# Research Log

## 2025-11-21
- Reorganized GitHub structure.
- Trying to find coupling direction for EDFM low-permeability fracture extension.
- Suspect instability in current CutFEM implementation.

## 2025-11-20
- Biot-Brinkman DG stabilized after adding term.
- Level-set cut interface still problematic in some cases.

## TODO
- Read the reference on CutFEM stabilization.
- Design new convergence test.
